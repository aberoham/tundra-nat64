// If a macro's name ends with 'UNSAFE', it means that at least one of its arguments is used more than once in its
//  expansion/definition.
// Therefore, arguments "passed" to these macros must always be expressions which cannot possibly have any side
//  effects - while simple literals, constants or variables are fine, anything more sophisticated may not be OK.
